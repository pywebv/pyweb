        """This decorator is used to handle callback queries. All arguments are optional.

        Parameters:

            query (str | list[str], optional): Query on which your function is called. Defaults to None, to handle all queries if your function handles all or if using 'filters'

            startswith (bool, optional): Set to True if you want your function to handle all queries starting with the query_string. Defaults to False.

            owner_only (bool, optional): Allow only owner to use this command. Defaults to False.

            sudo_only (bool, optional): Allow only sudos to use this command. Includes owner as sudo automatically. Defaults to False.

            group (int, optional): Define a group for this handler. Defaults to 0. [Read More](https://docs.pyrogram.org/topics/more-on-updates#handler-groups)

            filters (pyrogram.filters, optional): Extra filters to apply in your function. Import ``filters`` from pyrogram or pystark to use this. See example below.

        Examples:

            ```python
            from pyweb import Web

            # The normal and easiest way.
            # Bot will execute function, if button with callback_data 'first_button' is pressed/clicked.
            @Web.callback('first_button')

            # Handle multiple callback queries in one function. Mainly used to show same result or do some other pythonic thing, like if-else loop.
            # Bot will execute same function, if 'first_button' or 'second_button' is pressed/clicked.
            @Web.callback(['first_button', 'second_button'])

            # Function will only be triggered if owner presses the button, that is, the user whose id is set as OWNER_ID in environment variables.
            # Others will be ignored.
            @Web.callback('first_button', owner_only=True)

            # Function will only be triggered if sudo users or owner presses the button, that is, users set as SUDO_USERS or OWNER_ID in environment variables.
            # Others will be ignored.
            @Web.callback('first_button', sudo_only=True)

            # Filter/Handle all queries.

            # Use positive integer to execute after executing another function in default group that also filtered this query.
            @Web.callback(group=1)

            # or Use negative integer to execute before executing another function in default group that also filtered this query.
            @Web.callback(group=-1)

            # Don't use this as other functions that handle queries won't work.
            @Web.callback()

            # Filter other type of queries using 'filters' argument.

            # Import filters from pyrogram or pyweb.
